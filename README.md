## Overview
This project is a comprehensive refactor of a statistical analysis study (originally developed in R for STAT 412) into a production-ready **Python Machine Learning Pipeline**.

The objective is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K based on census data (`salary.csv`), utilizing advanced feature engineering and supervised learning algorithms.

## Project Evolution (R → Python)
The original study utilized **R (dplyr, caret, VIM)** for statistical inference. This repository modernizes the workflow using **Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn Pipelines)** to demonstrate:
- **Reproducibility:** End-to-end script from raw data to model evaluation.
- **Data Engineering:** Handling missing values (`?` to `NaN`), grouping sparse categories (e.g., Government jobs), and KNN imputation.
- **Benchmarking:** Comparing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

## Key Features
* **Preprocessing Pipeline:** * Automatic handling of missing values (imputation).
    * Grouping high-cardinality features (e.g., `workclass`, `marital-status`).
    * One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
* **Model Evaluation:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix analysis.

## Results
Based on the test set evaluation, the **Random Forest Classifier** yielded the best balance between precision and recall.

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Random Forest** | **~85%** | **0.84** |
| Logistic Regression | ~83% | 0.82 |
| Decision Tree | ~81% | 0.80 |

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/mrkn7/income-prediction-pipeline.git](https://github.com/mrkn7/income-prediction-pipeline.git)
